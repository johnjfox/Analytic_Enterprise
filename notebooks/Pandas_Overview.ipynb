    "As I mentioned before, DataFrames consist of a table of data, column labels, and row labels. Typically, columns are used to represent variables and the column labels give us their names. In our original example, the second column has the name Sepal_Length and its values follow below it. In one representation of the data, the rows can be used to capture all of the variables associated with a single observation. In this case the row labels give us a way to label an observation with a name so that it can be easily refered to.  In Python, these row labels are typically refered to as the \"index\""

    "1. In this simple example, our vectorized operation was division. Arguably the single most important part of pandas and numpy (the numerical processing library that pandas is built on) are the large number of vectorized operations provided. It's not just simple arithmetic; it's essentially anything you can imagine doing with a table or an array.\n",
    "2. Why is this important? Well, it's probably not at all obvious from this extremely small and simple example, but using vectorized operations is MUCH MUCH MUCH faster than looping over data in Python. If you can use vectorized operations, you should. It will take some time to get used to this notion, but it will be well worth the effort.\n",
    "3. Now, as you probably noticed, the results of these two operations aren't 100% exactly the same. The first approach resulted in a list. The second approach left everything as a DataFrame (or more precisely a Series). If we absolutely need to obtain a list for some reason, we can always convert the result of the DataFrame into a list when we're done."
