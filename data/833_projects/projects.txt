Q: How much do you want to work on this project?
T: Does the lack of lighting on streets support grafitti vandalism?
U: busatrio@bu.edu
M: busatrio@bu.edu
N: 
D: As we see in the news (https://www.google.com/#q=boston+graffiti+vandalism&safe=off&tbm=nws) that graffiti vandalism cases are still here in Boston. Does the lack of lighting on Boston streets contributes to those cases? We can compare the data on street lighting locations, the data of graffiti cases from Boston Police, and the tweets that goes into @NotifyBoston about graffiti, to determine whether those crimes occurred in the less lighting locations. If there is a correlation, I am sure we can do something to stop graffiti vandalism!
E: The streetlight locations: https://data.cityofboston.gov/Facilities/Streetlight-Locations/7hu5-gg2y More streetlight locations: https://data.cityofboston.gov/Permitting/Approved-Building-Permits/msk6-43c6?q=streetlight Tweet reports about streetlight: https://data.cityofboston.gov/City-Services/Tweets-sent-from-any-user-tagging-the-NotifyBoston/mjtg-hw8v?q=streetlight Boston Police cases about graffiti: https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/Boston-Police-Department-FIO/xmmk-i78r?q=graffiti Tweet reports about graffiti: https://data.cityofboston.gov/City-Services/Tweets-sent-from-any-user-tagging-the-NotifyBoston/mjtg-hw8v?q=graffiti Public site spotting the crime: http://spotcrime.com/ma/boston
T: Traffic Flow Improvement
U: jjpowe13@bu.edu
M: jjpowe13@bu.edu
N: 
D: There is a data set of reports of traffic jams provided by Waze. I wanted to look more into this data set to explore which intersections / streets had the highest reports of jams, and try to understand what is causing these traffic jams, and whether or not there is something that we can do to improve the traffic in that area.

T: Alcohol Licenses
U: nathan2@bu.edu
M: nathan2@bu.edu
N: 
D: Are alcohol licenses concentrated in poor neighborhoods? There is a common perception in some cities that this is true and takes advantage of those is economically disadvantaged situations. Is this the case in Boston or are there others explanations for where licenses are granted?

T: Do shorter names really get paid more?
U: leishman@bu.edu
M: leishman@bu.edu
N: 
D: We could examine a basic question, such as, which offices spend the most on salary? However, we could do something a little more interesting. A Forbes article from 2013 (see link below) said that shorter names get paid more. Is that true for the City of Boston? We could compare name length in characters against salary.

T: Parking tickets data for incentivising parking lots
U: akshaydp@bu.edu
M: akshaydp@bu.edu
N: 
D: Parking tickets data can be analysed to incentive private and public paid parking lot owners to build multi level parking to accommodate the deficit in parking spaces that leads to tickets. Surge pricing can be used to fund the project.

T: Identify parking needs around Boston
U: ajje@bu.edu
M: ajje@bu.edu
N: 
D: We will take data from parking tickets around the city, along with data from traffic at different times during the day, divided by week days and weekends. With this data in a map, we will identify where parking needs are
E: https://data.cityofboston.gov/
T: Timeliness of 311 Service
U: jfcarr@bu.edu
M: jfcarr@bu.edu
N: 
D: The goal of this project is to look at how timely 311 requests are being serviced. Use the 311, Service Requests report to review the On-Time Status of requests broken down by location. Also compare the Open Date with the Closed Date to understand the total elapsed time, and compare the Target Date with the Closed Date to understand specifically how early or late requests are being finished. Also, we can filter by specific categories, such as Type of request, Source of request, and Closure Reason to better compare similar cases across locations. This analysis can be used to understand considerations including the following: are certain locations responsible for different types of requests, are certain locations receiving quicker service, and do the results point to any resource deployment opportunities.

T: Liquor Licensing Limits
U: meyerke@bu.edu
M: meyerke@bu.edu
N: 
D: Look at disparities between neighborhoods, and how the price of liquor licenses prevents certain populations from accessing this resource. Does this lend itself to gentrification, as more expensive restaurants are correlated with wealthier areas?
E: https://data.cityofboston.gov/dataset/Liquor-Licenses/hda6-fnsh
T: Crime Incident Reports 
U: nkf531@bu.edu
M: nkf531@bu.edu

T: Power and Potholes
U: annai@bu.edu
M: annai@bu.edu
N: 
D: This project will create a map that depicts 311 issues and how long they took to repair. It will then add on city councilor districts, in an attempt to find a trend. Do some city councilors have more power than others, and is this reflected in the city's responsiveness to issues in their districts?
E: https://data.cityofboston.gov/d/wivc-syw7?category=City-Services&view_name=Closed-Pothole-Cases
T: Parking tickets & public transportation 
U: arvinds@bu.edu
M: arvinds@bu.edu
N: 
D: Analyze the parking tickets and public transportation data and see whether there is a relationship between those two. For example, a lot of people drive to a place which is not accessible easily by public transportation. This means, lesser parking spots and hence parking tickets. 
E: https://data.cityofboston.gov/dataset/Parking-Tickets/qbxx-ev3s
T: Zip Codes with the best food inspections scores

T: Housing vacancy rates map of Boston
U: jasondai@bu.edu
M: jasondai@bu.edu
N: 
D: There are 250,000 college students in Boston. When students are out of city in summer vacation, Boston is nearly empty. So are houses. It would be very interesting to map out how housing vacancy rates change in different seasons in Boston. There are some data available below. But more data is needed to draw a map of housing vacancy rates.

T: Rodents and Pests
U: mazdul@bu.edu
M: mazdul@bu.edu
N: 
D: Create map of most complaints of rodent and pest infestation. Identify potential issues and steps that can be taken. Two databases can be used for this purpose. The service request map can be useful to identify areas from which most complaints came. Additionally the database of food establishment inspection would be helpful too. It is possible that in some areas infestation is much and expensive to control which might be the reason some outlets failed the inspection. Also, the food establishments might be creating problems for the locality and needs action. Analysis and recommendation can be provided.

T: New construction and housing prices in Boston
U: mhazizaj@bu.edu
M: mhazizaj@bu.edu
N: 
D: Housing prices in Boston keep rising and as the city becomes less affordable new constructions are popping like mushrooms all over Boston. As part of this idea I would like to look into new construction permits in various neighborhoods of Boston in conjunction with income level data as well as hosing prices in an attempt to understand how the city is developing, where most construction is happening, where will the next "hot" areas for buyers be, how is this related with the income level and so forth.

T: How zoning changes over time
U: ajje@bu.edu
M: ajje@bu.edu
N: 
D: Using data from building permits granted and denied over time, we will check how the zones of Boston have been changing over time, and maybe using other sources of data, verify best zones for business, buying homes for long-term, or buying homes for renting to students, given the zoning trends through each area
E: https://data.cityofboston.gov/
T: Pest Infestation
U: swk@bu.edu
M: swk@bu.edu
N: 
D: Look into the areas that have the most pest infestation issues. I've always heard Fenway was notorious for rat issues. I want to see where pests are most likely to be a problem, explore the area, look for reasons, and maybe find a solution. 
E: data.cityofboston.gov
T: Where did Boston have problems plowing last winter
U: chrisld@bu.edu
M: chrisld@bu.edu
N: 
D: There were many calls about plowing last year. I'm curious if those areas requesting plowing were spread out or close together, and if they were next to main roads that would have been plowed.

T: Property value prediction
U: arvinds@bu.edu
M: arvinds@bu.edu
N: 
D: Predicting the fluctuation in property value based on the property value assessment data and combining it with other data sets including crime rate, hospital location etc. It's also important to see the correlation with data sets like crime rate before using it as a variable.

T: Connecting Food Sanitation Issues and Crime
U: astraley@bu.edu
M: astraley@bu.edu
N: 
D: Looking at 311 data we can see a number of restaurants with food sanitation failures. It would be interesting to connect this with crime rates in those areas, and perhaps even specific types of crime to see if there's a connection suggesting certain areas simply take the law less seriously for certain types of crimes at least.

T: Property Tax Optimization
U: cherella@bu.edu
M: cherella@bu.edu
N: 
D: Use property sales data to optimize property tax rates. Using comps in a data set would allow the city to increase or decrease property tax rates so that property taxes are administered in the most fair manner possible.
E: I don't know it
T: Improving 911 Dispatch
U: jjpowe13@bu.edu
M: jjpowe13@bu.edu
N: 
D: There is a data set available that lists the daily 911 dispatch by agency. With this data, we can look for trends in 911 calls, which agency they are for (police, fire, ambulance) and if month / time of year plays a factor into the kinds of calls the 911 dispatchers receive. With this information we might be able to help these agencies improve staffing. We could also try to potentially find causation for calls, and work to find solutions to prevent incidents. 
E: https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/911-Daily-Dispatch-Count-By-Agency/9rag-2mng
T: Where are most cars broken into?
U: chrisld@bu.edu
M: chrisld@bu.edu
N: 
D: The police department lists where crimes occur. Is there a street or specific location that you should not park if you don't want your car broken into? Is there a surprising location where lots of break ins occur that does not seems to make any sense? Also, what day of the weeks do they occur the most?

T: 311 Request Success
U: jbohn@bu.edu
M: jbohn@bu.edu

T: Wine and Dine! Which neighborhood to visit?
U: aayodeji@bu.edu
M: aayodeji@bu.edu
N: 
D: This project entails analyzing the list of food establishments in the city of Boston with active food licenses based on their geography. It aims to provide information about where one could get options of various food sellers, and probably get the lower price of food based on the advantage of concentration (All things being equal, competition drives down prices). This could be taken further by getting additional data on the average amount it cost to eat in a neighborhood. This is definitely not on the city data site, however, this data gives a starting point of telling the above story.
E: https://data.cityofboston.gov/Permitting/Active-Food-Establishment-Licenses/gb6y-34cq
T: Most reported types of crimes by day of week
U: leishman@bu.edu
M: leishman@bu.edu
N: 
D: What are the most common reported crimes on weekends vs. weekdays? Do geographic areas have the same number of crime reports on all days of the week, or are there “safer" days than others? Could this inform law enforcement to place more officers in one area on Mondays but in another area on Saturdays? This data could be combined in interesting ways with other data that has a day of week field.

T: Optimize snow removal work
U: pcchen@bu.edu
M: pcchen@bu.edu
N: 
D: According to the 311 service request, the number one 311 service complaint is about the snow. We can look into the data set and figure out which neighborhood have the highest amount of complaint, reasons why... etc, and cross analyze this data set with waze jam data under transportation and snow related call, to see if we can prioritize the snow removal work better.

T: 311: The Breakdown
U: ayellis@bu.edu
M: ayellis@bu.edu
N: 
D: Who uses 311? People obviously do, as reflected in the datasets with 311 requests. Some requests are illegitimate, some are overstated, and some are very real. Where are the calls coming from, are there specific areas where specific problems are reported more often? Is the system being used, as some think, just by a couple of '311 champions' whose use of the service revolves primarily around their homes/workplaces? By cleaning and mapping this data, 311 could be proven a success or reveal its weak spots and potential for improvement.

T: 311 Trends Over Time and Staffing
U: jfcarr@bu.edu
M: jfcarr@bu.edu
N: 
D: The goal of this project idea is to look at 311 request trends over time and compare it to staffing. First, we can use the 311, Service Requests to track the amount and type of requests over time. The City of Boston website has data going back until midway through 2011. By comparing year over year data, we can look at how these requests are increasing or decreasing over time. We can then incorporate the Employee Earnings Reports (for the same years) and look at how the number of individuals by Title, and align the titles with 311 request categories. In this way, we can see if staffing seems to be responding appropriately to changes in requests. We can also use this to look at request open and close times to see if there is a correlation.

U: dbzhang@bu.edu
M: dbzhang@bu.edu
N: 
D: Running is part of the fabric of this city. Boston is the home of the world’s oldest annual Marathon, and its population routinely ranks among the nation's fittest. However, most accidents involving runners occur at night when they are wearing dark clothing. Choosing a well lit route can help them be seen by motorists much sooner. It might not be the sexiest route to run on, but the most well-lit route will be the safest bet. The "Night Runner" App would provide night runners with properly planned routes, allowing them to get their workout in with minimal risk.

For instance, we might find a suspicious frequency of sexual harassment happening in one location and after investigating we could understand that the specific road doesn't have enough lighting or needs security cameras. In addition, I would like to look if there is any correlation the location of the police departments and the high/low concentration of criminality.

U: ayellis@bu.edu
M: ayellis@bu.edu
N: 
D: It is proven that the population of women in Boston has been growing faster than the population of men since 2001 (at least in sum, if not each individual year.) Now, what does this mean, what has caused it, and what implications does this have for Boston? Is the wage gap lesser in Boston? Do less/more women work than in a benchmark city (or US average)? Correlating data from population and its changes against an array of other data (new business, female executives, wage gap change, etc) could reveal very powerful insight for businesses and the city.

T: September Moving Truck Permits
U: jjpowe13@bu.edu
M: jjpowe13@bu.edu
N: 
D: I was looking at a heat map of where moving truck permits were issued in Boston in September 2015. I assumed the Allston/Brighton areas would have the most permits, because of the proximity to school, especially BU and BC, and because September would likely coincide with the school year. What I found was that Beacon Hill had the most activity on the heat map. Although Beacon Hill is close to schools like Suffolk, I do not typically think of it as a student neighborhood. So, I would like to explore whether students are not having as major of an impact on moving truck permits as I thought, or if it is another factor. Perhaps it is because Beacon Hill is more concentrated, or maybe it has to do with other socioeconomic factors.

D: The goal of this project idea is to understand trends in violations from food establishment inspections. First, we can use the Food Establishments report to find relationships between the likelihood of one violation and other violations. The data category "ViolDesc" can be used to group violation types. The goal is to determine if certain violations tend to co-occur with others, and what that means about the establishments with multiple violations. Could they benefit from more frequent check-ins? Or a mandatory training program?

D: I want to see if success in public schools is reflective of the amount of money that is put into the program, along with how the family demographic plays into part of the children's success. I want to see if crime, parental education, ease of transportation, and money... and how much weight it plays into a childs education in different areas around Boston. Looking at Newton north high school and newton south, they have an exorbitant amount of money placed into those programs, but is it the parents focus on education or the amount of money that leads to success. Of course I'd like to pull from a lot of other data sources.

Stay with me - we have access to the locations of all police stations in Boston, and then access to citations issued for myriad different law issues, such as code enforcement and crime incidents linked to below. Where do certain citation types occur, are any specific types clustered near or far away from police stations? When a new police station opens, what happens throughout Boston? This information can inform real estate concerns, public safety optimization, general awareness, and maybe find a new insight that changed policies could impact.

M: mefree@bu.edu
N: 
D: While sadly there is no database on every drug user or dealer in Boston, reported drug use might be observed to see and correlations to public high school performance. College and university performance could also be interesting. I know there are plenty of "good" schools in "bad" areas, but this is interesting particularly for Boston because of the drug use rate here in eastern Mass. I did not find performance data on schools, so this information might need to be accessed outside of the Open Government databases.

T: How to predict bus delay when going to work or to school?
U: busatrio@bu.edu
M: busatrio@bu.edu
N: 
D: When using the bus, having a delay in your route is an unpleasant thing. However, we can overcome it by predicting the delay before it happens. We can make a hypothesis of how long the delay occurs due to congestion or public works by using the following data: The traffic jam location from Waze; The data of constructions that has been built in that site; and the data of bus delay that passed through that place. Meanwhile, we can use MBTA API to get information about the expected arrival time of bus and the real arrival time of bus. Thus, we can combine the hypothesis, the result from MBTA API, and the data of ongoing constructions to measure where the delay starts and how long is the overdue. I am sure it will help Bostonian!

One of these data sets had Boston Zipcar memberships by zip code, and the other keeps track of actual Zipcar reservations in Boston. I wanted to try to look at these data sets to see if their is a correlation between the memberships and the reservations. I would also like to explore actual locations of where Zipcars are located. We could also compare this data to other things like T stop locations or Hubway bike locations, to see if these make a difference in Zipcar usage. We might be able to help Zipcar identify the best areas to advertise and better locations for car availability.

U: ebad@bu.edu
M: ebad@bu.edu
N: 
D: We can use the food pantries data to identify the areas where there are food shelters. We can then use this information to reduce wastage of food in restaurants. Restaurants located around these areas can send the extra food to these food shelters so that we can reduce the food wastage as well as provide some relief to these food shelters. We can also map this data to the restaurant location data to smoothen the process.

T: Nail Salons
U: nathan2@bu.edu
M: nathan2@bu.edu
N: 
D: Nail salons were recently in the news for possible mistreatment of its workers. While the initial New York Times article has been questioned, it would still be interesting to look at where nail salons in Boston are distributed and see if there is a correlation between their location and income level or demographics of the neighborhood. This could help the government determine if there are commonalities among nail salons or if they are differentiated so that they need to be treated using different criteria.

N: 
D: This project entails digging into the data containing the vehicle tax bills for Boston residents in 2014. The data in addition to tax shows the car make and year. This I felt is interesting, perhaps one could identify patterns in car make and year distribution in different neighborhoods (using Zip Codes). This may help advise ego driven people choose where to live and conversely what car to purchase. That apart, its also nice to know for information purpose.

We can use robbery data and location map it, with a filter for time. Based on this we could recommend streets to avoid and what time we would recommend avoiding them. This data could also be used to recommend officer patrolling schedules and areas.

U: astraley@bu.edu
M: astraley@bu.edu
N: 
D: If we analyze waze hazard data, zipcar membership by area and parking ticket data we may be able to get a sense of how an increase in rented cars (i.e. zipcars) will increase or decrease other issues. The hypothesis would be that with fewer people owning cars in that area you'll see lower traffic rates, which would correlate with some lower hazards, but other hazards might be increased (i.e. crashes) because people don't drive as much. You could probably also see this with higher rates of parking tickets in areas where people don't drive as much.

T: Video surveillance in high-crime neighborhoods
U: dbzhang@bu.edu
M: dbzhang@bu.edu
N: 
D: A growing number of cities across the United States and abroad have installed networks of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Police monitor the video in an effort to prevent crime and catch lawbreakers in the act. CCTV aims to increase the perceived risk of capture, a factor which will de-motivate the potential offender. A number of other benefits, beyond a reduction in crime, may be accrued from a CCTV system, including:Reduced fear of crime, aid to police investigations, provision of medical assistance, place management, information gathering, etc.

U: nkf531@bu.edu
M: nkf531@bu.edu
N: 
D: I was hoping to see the change in the number of tickets given in Boston due to the new Parking App along with the cost savings of labor on patrolling police officers who would issue tickets as i see it to be a much faster process. I would like to compare this to the supposed increase in captured parking meters along with the flow of traffic as people can no longer park their cars in specific spots for longer than the allowed time. So I want to gauge if this actually increased the happiness of the citizens of boston residents along with is it costing the city more or saving them money.
