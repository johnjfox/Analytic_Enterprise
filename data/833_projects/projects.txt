Q: How much do you want to work on this project?
T: Does the lack of lighting on streets support grafitti vandalism?
U: busatrio@bu.edu
M: busatrio@bu.edu
N: 
D: As we see in the news (https://www.google.com/#q=boston+graffiti+vandalism&safe=off&tbm=nws) that graffiti vandalism cases are still here in Boston. Does the lack of lighting on Boston streets contributes to those cases? We can compare the data on street lighting locations, the data of graffiti cases from Boston Police, and the tweets that goes into @NotifyBoston about graffiti, to determine whether those crimes occurred in the less lighting locations. If there is a correlation, I am sure we can do something to stop graffiti vandalism!
E: The streetlight locations: https://data.cityofboston.gov/Facilities/Streetlight-Locations/7hu5-gg2y More streetlight locations: https://data.cityofboston.gov/Permitting/Approved-Building-Permits/msk6-43c6?q=streetlight Tweet reports about streetlight: https://data.cityofboston.gov/City-Services/Tweets-sent-from-any-user-tagging-the-NotifyBoston/mjtg-hw8v?q=streetlight Boston Police cases about graffiti: https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/Boston-Police-Department-FIO/xmmk-i78r?q=graffiti Tweet reports about graffiti: https://data.cityofboston.gov/City-Services/Tweets-sent-from-any-user-tagging-the-NotifyBoston/mjtg-hw8v?q=graffiti Public site spotting the crime: http://spotcrime.com/ma/boston

U: jjpowe13@bu.edu
M: jjpowe13@bu.edu
N: 
D: There is a data set of reports of traffic jams provided by Waze. I wanted to look more into this data set to explore which intersections / streets had the highest reports of jams, and try to understand what is causing these traffic jams, and whether or not there is something that we can do to improve the traffic in that area.

T: Alcohol Licenses
U: nathan2@bu.edu
M: nathan2@bu.edu
N: 
D: Are alcohol licenses concentrated in poor neighborhoods? There is a common perception in some cities that this is true and takes advantage of those is economically disadvantaged situations. Is this the case in Boston or are there others explanations for where licenses are granted?

T: Liquor Licensing Limits
U: meyerke@bu.edu
M: meyerke@bu.edu
N: 
D: Look at disparities between neighborhoods, and how the price of liquor licenses prevents certain populations from accessing this resource. Does this lend itself to gentrification, as more expensive restaurants are correlated with wealthier areas?

T: Crime Incident Reports 
U: nkf531@bu.edu
M: nkf531@bu.edu

T: Where did Boston have problems plowing last winter
U: chrisld@bu.edu

T: Connecting Food Sanitation Issues and Crime
U: astraley@bu.edu
M: astraley@bu.edu
N: 
D: Looking at 311 data we can see a number of restaurants with food sanitation failures. It would be interesting to connect this with crime rates in those areas, and perhaps even specific types of crime to see if there's a connection suggesting certain areas simply take the law less seriously for certain types of crimes at least.

T: Improving 911 Dispatch
U: jjpowe13@bu.edu
M: jjpowe13@bu.edu
N: 
D: There is a data set available that lists the daily 911 dispatch by agency. With this data, we can look for trends in 911 calls, which agency they are for (police, fire, ambulance) and if month / time of year plays a factor into the kinds of calls the 911 dispatchers receive. With this information we might be able to help these agencies improve staffing. We could also try to potentially find causation for calls, and work to find solutions to prevent incidents.

T: Where are most cars broken into?
U: chrisld@bu.edu
M: chrisld@bu.edu
N: 
D: The police department lists where crimes occur. Is there a street or specific location that you should not park if you don't want your car broken into? Is there a surprising location where lots of break ins occur that does not seems to make any sense? Also, what day of the weeks do they occur the most?

T: 311: The Breakdown
U: ayellis@bu.edu
M: ayellis@bu.edu
N: 
D: Who uses 311? People obviously do, as reflected in the datasets with 311 requests. Some requests are illegitimate, some are overstated, and some are very real. Where are the calls coming from, are there specific areas where specific problems are reported more often? Is the system being used, as some think, just by a couple of '311 champions' whose use of the service revolves primarily around their homes/workplaces? By cleaning and mapping this data, 311 could be proven a success or reveal its weak spots and potential for improvement.

N: 
D: 311 Service request data analysis can be used to analyze which department is more responsive and quick in resolving residents complaints. Based on these results, Mayor's office can incentivize the departments that are more efficient.

D: It is proven that the population of women in Boston has been growing faster than the population of men since 2001 (at least in sum, if not each individual year.) Now, what does this mean, what has caused it, and what implications does this have for Boston? Is the wage gap lesser in Boston? Do less/more women work than in a benchmark city (or US average)? Correlating data from population and its changes against an array of other data (new business, female executives, wage gap change, etc) could reveal very powerful insight for businesses and the city.

D: Varify how interest people in Boston is changing or which area of services they tend to spend more money by using Entertainment license data. So knowing that information, City of Boston is able to prepare infrastructure for the interests. For example, if people started to spend more money on playing sports, city of boston can prepare more budget on supporting the community clubs or build up new sports center.

T: September Moving Truck Permits
U: jjpowe13@bu.edu
M: jjpowe13@bu.edu
N: 
D: I was looking at a heat map of where moving truck permits were issued in Boston in September 2015. I assumed the Allston/Brighton areas would have the most permits, because of the proximity to school, especially BU and BC, and because September would likely coincide with the school year. What I found was that Beacon Hill had the most activity on the heat map. Although Beacon Hill is close to schools like Suffolk, I do not typically think of it as a student neighborhood. So, I would like to explore whether students are not having as major of an impact on moving truck permits as I thought, or if it is another factor. Perhaps it is because Beacon Hill is more concentrated, or maybe it has to do with other socioeconomic factors.

U: nkf531@bu.edu
M: nkf531@bu.edu
N: 
D: I want to see if success in public schools is reflective of the amount of money that is put into the program, along with how the family demographic plays into part of the children's success. I want to see if crime, parental education, ease of transportation, and money... and how much weight it plays into a childs education in different areas around Boston. Looking at Newton north high school and newton south, they have an exorbitant amount of money placed into those programs, but is it the parents focus on education or the amount of money that leads to success. Of course I'd like to pull from a lot of other data sources.

D: What happens around police stations? Stay with me - we have access to the locations of all police stations in Boston, and then access to citations issued for myriad different law issues, such as code enforcement and crime incidents linked to below. Where do certain citation types occur, are any specific types clustered near or far away from police stations? When a new police station opens, what happens throughout Boston? This information can inform real estate concerns, public safety optimization, general awareness, and maybe find a new insight that changed policies could impact.

T: How to predict bus delay when going to work or to school?
U: busatrio@bu.edu
M: busatrio@bu.edu
N: 
D: When using the bus, having a delay in your route is an unpleasant thing. However, we can overcome it by predicting the delay before it happens. We can make a hypothesis of how long the delay occurs due to congestion or public works by using the following data: The traffic jam location from Waze; The data of constructions that has been built in that site; and the data of bus delay that passed through that place. Meanwhile, we can use MBTA API to get information about the expected arrival time of bus and the real arrival time of bus. Thus, we can combine the hypothesis, the result from MBTA API, and the data of ongoing constructions to measure where the delay starts and how long is the overdue. I am sure it will help Bostonian!

U: bazil@bu.edu
M: bazil@bu.edu
N: 
D: Help improve environmental efficiency by using Building Energy and Water Use Data. Help the city incentive the building with most emissions to upgrade and improve energy efficient. Policy can be built by looking at most inefficient users in more detail like the building construction date, type, use The city could offer incentives such as tax cuts and fee waivers targeted at specific user who they would mostly likely want to upgrade their building's energy efficiency . For e.g A annual tax cut for building built before 1935 who improve emission ratings to a certain level.

One of these data sets had Boston Zipcar memberships by zip code, and the other keeps track of actual Zipcar reservations in Boston. I wanted to try to look at these data sets to see if their is a correlation between the memberships and the reservations. I would also like to explore actual locations of where Zipcars are located. We could also compare this data to other things like T stop locations or Hubway bike locations, to see if these make a difference in Zipcar usage. We might be able to help Zipcar identify the best areas to advertise and better locations for car availability.

U: astraley@bu.edu
M: astraley@bu.edu
N: 
D: If we analyze waze hazard data, zipcar membership by area and parking ticket data we may be able to get a sense of how an increase in rented cars (i.e. zipcars) will increase or decrease other issues. The hypothesis would be that with fewer people owning cars in that area you'll see lower traffic rates, which would correlate with some lower hazards, but other hazards might be increased (i.e. crashes) because people don't drive as much. You could probably also see this with higher rates of parking tickets in areas where people don't drive as much.

N: 
D: I was hoping to see the change in the number of tickets given in Boston due to the new Parking App along with the cost savings of labor on patrolling police officers who would issue tickets as i see it to be a much faster process. I would like to compare this to the supposed increase in captured parking meters along with the flow of traffic as people can no longer park their cars in specific spots for longer than the allowed time. So I want to gauge if this actually increased the happiness of the citizens of boston residents along with is it costing the city more or saving them money.
